# Welcome to the Guide

## Requirements

We recommend **node.js** `>=20.x` as the runtime to use our library without any unknown errors or bugs. We support **ESM** by default, but it is compatiable with **CJS** too.

## Conclusion

This pkg was developed in Node.js runtime. Still it can be used in other `node.js` like runtimes such as `bun` or `deno 2.0` _(coming soon)_
